      What is our mission?
    </h3>
    <p>
      In addition to undermining archaic legislation we want to do our part in reducing the uncertainty
      associated with darknet trading as well as to promote a safe
      marketplace by establishing a peer-driven user rating
      system, which includes both the sellers and the buyers using the service.<br/>
      Our goal is to make the service as transparent & as accesible as possible for everyone.
